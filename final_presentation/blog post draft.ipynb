    "P/PET is a measurement commonly used to determine aridity and stress in plants. The \"P\" in \"P/PET\" refers to the amount of precipitation and the \"PET\" refers to evapotranspiration - the movement of water from soil to the atmosphere. This study used a P/PET value of 0.8, a baseline value for water stress in many crops. Over the time period assayed, this translates to an accumulated P/PET of 120 or lower. The centroid of the drought in this area has moved westward from 2014 - 2019. There was no agricultural drought detected in 2017.\n",

    "  - rainfall z-score\n",
    "  - PET z-score (EDDI)\n",
    " - help user decide on time period to assay\n",
    " - discuss implications with stakeholders (farmers, forest management profressionals) to determine useful future directions\n",
    " - use additional method of outlining droughted area beyond convex hull"
