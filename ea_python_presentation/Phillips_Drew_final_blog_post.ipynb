    ">“The problem of defining drought… has never been resolved to the satisfaction of all. ” \n",
    " -Kelly Redmond\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"drought\", like the term \"the economy\", is understood to affect most of the world's population yet a comprehensive definition is elusive. At the simplest level, drought occurs when water loss in an area exceeds water inflow in an area. Even this definition is flawed, however, since drought status changes based on the size of the area assayed. That is, a droughted area may lie unconnected to but within eyesight of an area with adequate water supplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the slippery definition, it is clear that droughts are becoming more intense as climate change affects long-standing weather patterns. Predicting droughts is likewise becoming more difficult. In the western United States, for example, snowpack is used to help predict droughts, but as snowpack decreases in a changing climate so does the accuracy of drought predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of drought's impacts lie \"downstream\", both figuratively and literally. As water supplies diminish, crops are not adequately irrigated; food insecurity and health both decline, and civil strife may follow. In North America, droughts are often inconveniences to our standards of living: we can no longer fill our pools and must water our lawns less frequently - so far. The developing world bears a disproportionate burden during drought conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should care about drought since it is a \"foundational problem\": a drought leads to ripples that radiate (often unpredictably) across different but linked issues: from crop production to quality of life. Drought itself may be a given, but our reaction to it is not. We can ask ourselves: what can we learn about drought that can lead to actionable steps to moderate its impact? By answering this, we can point towards managing the effects of climate change worldwide."

    "The U.S. Drought Monitor provides a drought index available at the county, state, and regional level for the United States. Government agencies such as the Farm Service Agency and the Internal Revenue Service depend on its accuracy, so it is an ideal source to start data exploration. The drought index is unique as it combines quantitative data (such as from the Standard Percipitation Index) with qualitative evaluation from experts. From these results, at least 50% of the county has been in a state of moderate drought since early March 2020. This plot was used to justify selection of Siskiyou County as this project's area of interest.\n",

    "The ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration (P/PET) was chosen as a potential drought indicator. P/PET is generally used as a measure of water stress in crops. When the P/PET ratio is above 1, more precipitation fell than water was lost to evaporation and via plant transpiration. When the ratio is less than 1, that relationship is reversed. This data exploration step measures P/PET in Yreka, the county seat of Siskiyou County.\n",

The dataset is noisy, however, so the decision was made to modify this indicator (next figure).\n",

Each polygon in the plot represents a 9km by 9km cell that aWhere ses for agronomic analysis and weather prediction. The last figure confirmed that A-P/PET provided a less noisy dataset for analysis. This plot shows that the majority of Siskiyou County has low levels of accumulated P/PET, with the areas representing historical norms lying outside of the county.
