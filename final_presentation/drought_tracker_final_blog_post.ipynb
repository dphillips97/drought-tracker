    "\n",
    "Droughts are difficult to define, let alone quantify. For this study, I chose **P/PET** as the indicator to indicate drought. P/PET is a measurement commonly used to determine aridity and water stress in plants. The \"P\" in \"P/PET\" refers to amount of precipitation and the \"PET\" refers to evapotranspiration - the movement of water from soil to the atmosphere. A value of close to 1 indicates that most of the water that has left a system has returned to recharge the groundwater in that system.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Threshold values of P/PET are as follows. At and below these values, evidence of water stress becomes apparent:\n",
    "\n",
    "| P/PET | What is affected| \n",
    "| ------|---------------|\n",
    "|  0.4  | Forests and rangeland | \n",
    "| 0.6 - 0.8 | Many crops | \n",
    "| 0.5 | This study | \n",
    "\n",
    "The area chosen was Josephine County, Oregon, a rural county that experiences cyclical severe droughts. I used the U.S. Drought Monitor to identify counties that were in the midst of a drought in April and May 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time period chosen was the approximate growing season, May 1st to October 31st, for the years 2014 through 2019.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Limitations of study\n",
    " 1. P/PET is a good measure for aridity and crop stress, not necesarily other types of drought. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future directions\n",
    "##### Statistical\n",
    "\n",
    " - Use zonal statistics to identify land use types and changes in droughted areas\n",
    " - Use spatial statistics to determine likelihood of drought's extent\n",
    " \n",
    "##### Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    " - How does P/PET change with crop productivity ?\n",
    " - What is the relationship of P/PET to fire risk and frequency?"
